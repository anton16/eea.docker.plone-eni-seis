## Usage

### Development

In order to be able to edit source-code on your machine using your favorite editor, without having to do it inside a Docker container, you'll have to create a new user on your laptop with `uid=500` and use this user for development:

    $ useradd -u 500 zope-www
    $ usermod -a -G docker zope-www
    $ sudo su - zope-www

Now get the source code:

    $ git clone https://github.com/eea/eea.docker.plone-eni-seis.git
    $ cd eea.docker.plone-eni-seis/devel

And the Plone Add-ons source code:

    $ docker-compose -f source-code.yml up

Start the application:

    $ docker-compose up

Within your favorite browser head to http://localhost:8080,
add a Plone site and install `eni.seis.theme` and `eni.seis.content` add-ons.

Now you are ready to develop Plone Add-ons within `src` folder:

    $ ls -l src/

Once you're done editing, restart the application and test your changes:

    $ docker-compose restart


### Deployment

    $ git clone https://github.com/eea/eea.docker.plone-eni-seis.git
